We all need a push in life with so much that goes on. The Srisakdi typeface felt to me with its cursive look as if someone is tapping on your sholder and saying everything is going to be fine. It is a reassuring typeface.
The second typeface is thin and feels soft-hearted; it is italic as the one who said the quotes had a very soft and caring heart.
For the text colour, I used white to symbolize purity, and the red draws attention to the text that reads, "DO NOT." The background colour black helps the words to stand out.
For my concept I used a single column grid.
In terms of type scale, I didn't adhere to a standardized set of font sizes, but rather adjusted the sizes visually to make everything look beautiful and balanced.
I didn't do much chalenges because to me what I have is a chaleng by it self.
